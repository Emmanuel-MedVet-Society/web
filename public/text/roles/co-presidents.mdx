Nina and Luke are both third year medical students intercalating in English and Pathology respectively. They oversee the society’s events and finances and work closely with the other members of the EMVS committee to organise a range of opportunities, events and resources for medical and veterinary students of Emmanuel College and the wider University. They have big ambitions for the society this year, aiming to culture innovation in all departments – including new socials, sources of funding and the ‘Medicine and Beyond’ lecture series which aims to give a platform to distinguished speakers from a range of medical and veterinary backgrounds to share details of their careers, ventures and research to students across the university.

As your social social secs this year, we are responsible for providing the wildest entertainment the Emma MedVet community has ever seen. We are all second year medics, struggling through MODA and BOD, who need the MedVet socials to get us through. We will be running pub crawls, social swaps with other colleges and formal swaps this year to help integrate the different years at Emma as well as introduce the freshers to different college medics. If you have any fun social ideas that you want to get through, please give us a message and weâ€™ll make it happen!

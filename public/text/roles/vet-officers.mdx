Holly and Catherine are both second years hoping to represent the voices of veterinary students at Emmanuel College. Their goals are to ensure EMVS is an inclusive, friendly community for both medics and vets. They will be the point of contact for vet students across colleges, and will create revision resources for the vet-specific modules that can be used year upon year. They aim to expand the societyâ€™s lecture series to include more representation of veterinarians, as well as encouraging lectures that span both the medical and veterinary profession, with a focus on One Health.

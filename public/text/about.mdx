Emmanuel MedVet Society (EMVS) is a well-established community connecting past and present medics and vets at Emmanuel College. With Emmanuel’s strong history of medvet admissions, the society has developed into a broad network that offers both support and career insights through events like formal dinners, networking opportunities, and lectures.

This year, we’re focusing on expanding our Medicine and Beyond lecture series, which introduces students to the variety within medical and veterinary careers. With speakers from areas as diverse as military medicine and Antarctic research, the series showcases the wide range of interests available to students, offering insights that go ‘beyond’ traditional understanding of what a career in medicine can be. By blending Cambridge’s esteemed academic traditions with the exciting future of medical research, EMVS aims to provide Emmanuel students with a rounded understanding of their professional options within and beyond the usual pathways.

Emma MedVetSoc is always looking to broaden our impact through contacts beyond the University of Cambridgeâ€™s walls. With our contacts within the wider academic community here, we have access to almost 2000 enthusiastic MedVet students, many of whom would love to get involved in any opportunity you have to offer. We also have access to the facilities of Emmanuel College in particular, such as our numerous lecture halls, and a number of distinguished Fellows. If you are interested in sponsoring or leading an event with us, please reach out to emmamedvetsoc@societies.cam.ac.uk!
